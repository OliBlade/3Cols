# About The Editor üñäÔ∏è

You may have noticed we've switched to [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) Editor. 
This means we can now offer better language support, syntax highlighting and showing errors. 

You can enable additional features using the "Settings" button in the right controls. Please note these settings are cached, and may revert if the cache is cleared
